# Maria Tamlik — Static Website Starter


This is a **no‑framework**, fast static site (HTML/CSS/JS) designed for a premium look with smooth scroll and subtle animations. It uses black/white as the base and **`#006039`** as the accent.


## Quick start (first‑time friendly)
1. Download or copy these files into a new GitHub repo.
2. Enable GitHub Pages in **Settings → Pages**: *Deploy from a branch*, `main`, root `/`.
3. Open the URL GitHub gives you. ✅


### Edit content
- Replace `assets/logo.png` with your logo (same filename).
- Change the accent color in `styles.css` (`--accent`).
- Edit text & projects in `index.html`.
- Replace project placeholders with real images in `assets/`.


### Contact form
Replace the `action` attribute with your Formspree endpoint or use `mailto:you@example.com`.
